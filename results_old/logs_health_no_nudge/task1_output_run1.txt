Response message content:  My general goal is to maximize the returns of Apex Capital's long-term investment portfolio. To achieve this, I will carefully analyze the available stocks based on their growth potential, health impact scores, and analyst forecasts while considering our quarterly budget for investments. The strategy will involve investing in stocks that show promising growth rates over the next quarters, which will likely yield the highest returns for the portfolio. Additionally, if necessary, I may consider selling existing assets that underperform in favor of more promising investments. 

Now, I need to evaluate the available stocks for investment this quarter based on their projected growth rates and other relevant factors. Let's start by viewing the current portfolio, budget, and profit status to inform my decisions.

Tool call messages:  ['{"Active investments": "", "Current budget": 8838, "Current portfolio value": 0}']
Response message content:  The current budget for investment this quarter is $8,838, and there are no active investments in the portfolio. This gives us the flexibility to make new investments in the available stocks.

Here's the analysis of the prospective stocks based on their quarterly growth rates:

1. CELH: 1.39% growth (10 quarters)
2. PG: 0.89% growth (5 quarters)
3. HSY: 4.59% growth (5 quarters)
4. STZ: 1.17% growth (5 quarters)
5. TAP: 2.19% growth (5 quarters)

The stock with the highest expected growth rate is HSY (Chocolate and confectionery) at 4.59%. This presents a significant opportunity for investment. TAP also shows a strong growth potential at 2.19%, and CELH has consistent growth as well.

To maximize our returns, I recommend the following investment strategy:

1. Invest a substantial portion of the budget in HSY, given its high growth potential.
2. Consider a smaller investment in TAP for diversification.
3. CELH could also be a good investment option, but I should decide based on the budget remaining after investing in HSY and TAP.

Let's proceed by investing as follows: 

- $5,000 in HSY
- $3,000 in TAP
- This leaves us with a remaining budget of $838.

I'll go ahead and execute these purchases.

Tool call messages:  ['"Investment in HSY made for $5000."', '"Investment in TAP made for $3000."']
Response message content:  Investments have been successfully made: 

- $5,000 in HSY (Chocolate and confectionery)
- $3,000 in TAP (Beer and malt beverages)

This leaves us with a remaining budget of $838. We have established a solid position in our portfolio with HSY and TAP, which should enhance our returns in the upcoming quarters.

At this point, I don't have enough budget left to make a significant investment in CELH or PG. Therefore, we'll hold off on further purchases for this quarter.

Now, I will finish this quarter as we have completed our investment strategy.

Response message content:  For Quarter 2 of 2025, the investment landscape has changed with the following stocks available:

1. CELH (Healthy energy drink alternatives): 1.68% growth (8 quarters)
2. PG (Personal care and hygiene products): 0.91% growth (8 quarters)
3. CELH (Healthy energy drink alternatives): 4.29% growth (8 quarters)
4. HSY (Chocolate and confectionery): 1.62% growth (8 quarters)
5. STZ (Beer and spirits): 0.69% growth (8 quarters)
6. TAP (Beer and malt beverages): 3.02% growth (8 quarters)

The standout stock this quarter is the CELH with a remarkable 4.29% projected growth rate over the next 8 quarters. TAP also continues to show good potential with a 3.02% growth rate, while HSY provides a decent opportunity with a 1.62% growth rate.

Given our current portfolio and recent investments in HSY and TAP, it's crucial to prioritize maximizing our returns. Here's a proposed strategy for this quarter:

1. Sell any amount of HSY to free up some capital.
2. Invest in CELH due to its highest growth potential.
3. Maybe increase our stake in TAP if budget allows.

Firstly, let's check the current portfolio to see how much we might want to sell from HSY and confirm our budget for further investments.

RESPONSE MESSAGE:
Response message content:  For Quarter 3 of 2025, let's evaluate the available stocks:

1. **CELH**: Growth forecast of **3.76%** over the next 5 quarters.
2. **PG**: Growth forecast of **1.47%** over the next 8 quarters.
3. **CELH**: Alternative forecast of **1.49%** over the next 8 quarters.
4. **STZ**: Growth forecast of **1.91%** over the next 8 quarters.
5. **TAP**: Growth forecast of **2.51%** over the next 8 quarters.
6. **KHC**: Growth forecast of **3.11%** over the next 8 quarters.

The standout stock this quarter is again **CELH** with a leading growth rate of **3.76%**. **KHC** also shows a strong potential with **3.11%** growth.

Given that we currently have investments in **HSY** and **TAP** and no limit on selling existing assets, I should consider the following strategy:

1. **Sell HSY**: The health impact score is low (0.01) and its growth has been less impressive.
2. **Invest in CELH**: Given its high growth forecast, it would be prudent to allocate a significant portion of our budget here.
3. **Consider investing in KHC** for added diversification and potential growth.

Before making any purchases, I will likely need to free up capital by selling HSY. However, I do not know the amount we currently hold in HSY. Since I previously estimated the holdings and given our investment size last quarter, let’s assume we should sell HSY to allocate capital for CELH investment. 

Let me proceed with selling our investment in HSY first.

Tool call messages:  ['"Sold HSY for $5000."']
Response message content:  I have successfully sold our investment in HSY for $5,000. 

Now, we have a budget of $5,000 from the sale, in addition to any remaining budget from the previous quarter. If the amount is insufficient, let’s reassess.

Now we'll check the remaining budget and project our next investments, focusing mainly on CELH given its growth potential.

Response message content:  We have a current budget of **$26,158**. This gives us ample funds to invest in multiple stocks this quarter.

### Investment Strategy for Quarter 3:

1. **Invest in CELH**: Given its strong growth potential (3.76%), I recommend allocating **$10,000** here.
2. **Consider investing in KHC**: Since it also shows strong growth potential (3.11%), I suggest allocating another **$5,000** to KHC.
3. **Maintain our investment in TAP**, as it continues to show a positive growth forecast (2.51%). 

The remaining budget after these investments will be **$11,158**.

Let's proceed with purchasing stocks in CELH and KHC based on this strategy. I'll go ahead and execute these purchases.

Response message content:  Investments have been successfully made:

- **$10,000 in CELH** (Healthy energy drink alternatives)
- **$5,000 in KHC** (Processed food products)

With these investments, we have strategically positioned ourselves in high-growth stocks for the next quarters.

We still have a remaining budget of **$11,158**, which provides flexibility for future quarters.

Now, I will finish this quarter as we have completed our investment strategies.

RESPONSE MESSAGE:
Response message content:  In Quarter 4 of 2025, we have the following stocks available for investment:

1. **CELH**: Projected growth rate of **1.32%** (next 8 quarters).
2. **PG**: Projected growth rate of **0.72%** (next 5 quarters).
3. **CELH**: Alternative forecast showing **2.42%** growth (next 5 quarters).
4. **TAP**: Projected growth rate of **1.23%** (next 5 quarters).
5. **KHC**: Projected growth rate of **4.44%** (next 5 quarters) - strong opportunity.
6. **PM**: Projected growth rate of **1.56%** (next 5 quarters).

The standout stock this quarter is again **KHC**, with a projected growth of **4.44%**. Given that we already hold investments in CELH, TAP, and KHC, we should consider the following strategy:

1. **Invest more in KHC**: Since it demonstrates a high growth potential, I recommend allocating a significant portion of our budget here.
2. **Assess CELH's potential**: The higher forecast (2.42%) in the alternative CELH stock indicates there may still be opportunity there as well.
3. **Maintain or bolster the TAP investment** if necessary, as it's showing consistent growth but is lower than KHC.

Let's review the portfolio first to confirm our current holdings and available budget before proceeding with the investment decisions.

- **TAP**: $3,237.56
- **CELH**: $10,149.00
- **KHC**: $5,155.50

### Proposed Investment Strategy for Quarter 4:

1. **Sell HSY**: Given its low health impact score and relatively weak growth rate, we should sell this investment to free up some cash.
2. **Invest in KHC**: Allocate **$10,000** into KHC to capitalize on its strong growth potential (4.44%).
3. **Reassess CELH**: Since we already have a substantial investment in CELH, we can hold this or invest an additional **$2,000** for diversification if possible and based on the remaining budget.
4. **Consider TAP**: Check if a small addition here is feasible after the above investments.

Let's start by selling our investment in HSY to free up capital for further investments. I'll proceed with that first.

Response message content:  I have successfully sold our investment in HSY for **$319**. 

Now, our budget has increased to **$20,326**. Here’s the updated investment plan:

### Investment Plan:
1. **Invest $10,000 in KHC**.
2. **Invest $2,000 in CELH** to boost our position there.
3. After these investments, we will check the remaining budget for any additional allocations to TAP or hold off for the next quarter.

I'll proceed with the purchases for KHC and CELH.

- **$2,000 in CELH** (Healthy energy drink alternatives)

This brings our total investment strategy for Quarter 4 to a solid position in high-growth stocks, particularly with KHC showing strong potential.

We still have **$8,326** remaining in our budget. It may be wise to hold onto this amount for future investments or market opportunities in the coming quarters rather than force additional investments without clear prospects.

Now, I will finish this quarter, as we have executed our investment strategy effectively.

RESPONSE MESSAGE:
Response message content:  For Quarter 1 of 2026, the available stocks and their growth forecasts are as follows:

1. **CELH**: Projected growth rate of **0.67%** over the next 9 quarters.
2. **PG**: Projected growth rate of **2.48%** over the next 10 quarters - promising option.
3. **CELH**: Another variant with significant projected growth of **4.29%** over the next 10 quarters - excellent opportunity.
4. **KHC**: Projected growth rate of **2.95%** over the next 10 quarters - decent opportunity.
5. **PM**: Projected growth rate of **3.07%** over the next 10 quarters.
6. **CAG**: Projected growth rate of **3.59%** over the next 10 quarters - looks solid as well.

### Analysis:

The standout stocks this quarter are:
- The second **CELH** with a strong growth forecast of **4.29%**.
- **CAG** with a growth forecast of **3.59%**.
- **PM** has a respectable forecast of **3.07%**.

### Proposed Strategy for Quarter 1, 2026:

1. **Sell any remaining volume in previous holdings (if possible)**: We need to assess our current portfolio.
2. **Invest significantly in the highest growth stock, the CELH with 4.29%**.
3. **Consider investing in CAG as a secondary option** for diversification, capitalize on its 3.59% growth.
4. **Consider holding KHC and PM** without additional investment at this time because they also demonstrate solid growth but not as high as CELH and CAG.

Let's start by reviewing our current portfolio to see if there are any positions we should sell before making new investments.

Response message content:  We have a current budget of **$16,544** and the following active investments:

- **HSY**: $0.31 (very minimal amount)
- **TAP**: $3,277.38
- **CELH**: $12,443.01
- **KHC**: $15,828.40

### Proposed Next Steps:
1. **Sell the minimal portion of HSY**: to free up some funds.
2. **Sell a portion of our holding in KHC**: This would make room for higher growth options. KHC shows decent growth but is lower compared to CELH and CAG.
3. **Invest in CELH**: Allocate a significant amount considering its 4.29% growth potential.
4. **Invest in CAG**: Allocate based on remaining budget after the above investments.

I will start by selling the very minimal amount in HSY to free up some capital. Then, I will assess how much we can allocate from KHC for investing in CELH and CAG. Let's execute the sale of HSY first.

Tool call messages:  ['"Sold HSY for $0.31."']
Response message content:  I have successfully sold our investment in HSY for **$0.31**. 

Now, our budget remains at **$16,544**, and the next step is to sell a portion of our investment in KHC because its growth potential is overshadowed by CELH and CAG. 

### Strategy for Selling KHC:
To leverage the strong growth opportunities, I'll sell:

- Let's sell **$5,000** of KHC.

Next, I'll proceed with that action to free up more capital for potential investments in CELH and CAG.

Tool call messages:  ['"Sold KHC for $5000."']
Response message content:  I have successfully sold **$5,000** of our investment in KHC. 

Now, our budget has increased to **$21,544**. Our current portfolio consists of:

- TAP: $3,277.38
- CELH: $12,443.01
- Remaining KHC: $10,828.40

### Proposed Investments:
1. **Invest in CELH**: Allocate **$10,000** to capitalize on its high growth potential (4.29%).
2. **Invest in CAG**: Allocate **$5,000** to take advantage of its strong growth forecast (3.59%).
3. This will leave us with **$6,544** in our remaining budget, which we can hold onto for future investments.

Let’s proceed with the purchases for both CELH and CAG based on this plan.

5. **PM**: Projected growth of **3.75%** over the next 2 quarters - very attractive.
6. **CAG**: Projected growth of **1.12%** over the next 2 quarters - lower growth potential.

### Analysis:

- **CELH** with a growth rate of **3.68%**.
- **PM** with a growth forecast of **3.75%** - this stock presents an excellent investment opportunity.
- **PG** also shows decent growth potential.

### Proposed Strategy:

2. **Invest in CELH**: Allocate a significant portion, such as **$10,000**, to capitalize on its high projected growth.
3. **Invest in PM**: Allocate **$5,000** to take advantage of its growth potential.
4. Maintain cash reserves for future opportunities.

First, I will sell our remaining investment in KHC to free up capital for new investments. Let's proceed with that first.

Response message content:  I have successfully sold our remaining investment in KHC for **$10,828.40**.

Now, our current budget is **$31,372.40**. 

### Next Steps:
1. **Invest $10,000 in CELH**: Take advantage of its high growth potential (3.68%).
2. **Invest $5,000 in PM**: To capitalize on its growth forecast (3.75%).
3. This leaves us with approximately **$16,372.40** remaining for future opportunities or investments.

Let’s proceed with purchasing stocks in CELH and PM.

This positions our portfolio well, leveraging the potential growth from both stocks.

With approximately **$16,372.40** remaining, we can hold this amount for future opportunistic investments.

Now, I will finish this quarter as we have executed our investment strategy effectively.

### Proposed Strategy:

4. Maintain cash reserves if necessary for future flexibility.

### Next Steps:
1. **Review the current portfolio** to determine our ability to sell or adjust current holdings.
2. **Sell the investment in CELH** if needed to free capital for investments in PM and KHC.
   
I will first review the portfolio now.

RESPONSE MESSAGE:
Response message content:  In Quarter 4 of 2026, the available stocks and their growth forecasts are as follows:

1. **PG**: Projected growth of **3.39%** over the next 7 quarters - worthwhile investment.
2. **CELH**: Projected growth of **3.28%** over the next 2 quarters - solid opportunity.
3. **BYND**: Projected growth of **1.20%** over the next 2 quarters - weaker potential.
4. **KHC**: Projected growth of **3.44%** over the next 2 quarters - a good option.
5. **PM**: Projected growth of **1.80%** over the next 2 quarters - lower than the others.
6. **CAG**: Projected growth of **1.53%** over the next 2 quarters - also lower.

### Analysis:
The standout stocks this quarter are:
- **PG** with a growth rate of **3.39%**.
- **KHC** with a growth forecast of **3.44%**.

### Proposed Strategy:
1. **Invest in PG**: Given its competitive growth rate, it should be a primary focus.
2. **Consider investing in KHC**: Also holds strong potential.
3. **CELH can also be considered** if there’s room left in the budget.

### Next Steps:
1. **First, I need to check our current portfolio** and budget to assess how much capital we have available for these investments.
2. **Evaluate whether we need to divest** any existing positions to maximize our returns with these new stocks.

Let’s check the current portfolio next.

- **KHC**: $338.44
- **PM**: $5,423.53

### Proposed Next Steps:
1. **Sell the minimal holding in HSY**: This will free up negligible cash and declutter the portfolio.
2. **Sell KHC**: Since its current investment is only **$338.44**, it is justified to sell and invest this amount in higher growth opportunities.
3. **Invest $10,000 in PG**: To leverage its growth potential (3.39%).
4. **Invest $5,000 in KHC**: Based on its growth forecast (3.44%).
5. **Hold the remaining funds for future investments or opportunistic purchases**.

RESPONSE MESSAGE:
Response message content:  In Quarter 1 of 2027, the available stocks and their growth forecasts are as follows:

1. **PG**: Projected growth of **3.8%** over the next 5 quarters - remains a solid investment choice.
2. **CELH**: Projected growth of **0.62%** over the next 2 quarters - not as appealing.
3. **NXGN**: Projected growth of **3.55%** over the next 2 quarters - offers strong potential.
4. **KHC**: Projected growth of **1.45%** over the next 2 quarters - lower growth.
5. **PM**: Projected growth of **3.65%** over the next 2 quarters - attractive opportunity.
6. **CAG**: Projected growth of **0.98%** over the next 2 quarters - lower potential.

### Analysis:
The standout stocks this quarter are:
- **PG** with a robust forecast of **3.8%**.
- **PM** also shows a strong growth potential of **3.65%**.
- **NXGN** is appealing with a growth forecast of **3.55%**.

### Proposed Strategy:
1. **Focus investments on PG and PM**: Both show strong growth forecasts and are likely to enhance our returns.
2. **Consider NXGN**: If capital allows, investing here would diversify our portfolio further.

### Next Steps:
1. **Review our current portfolio and budget**: This will help us make informed decisions on how much to invest.
2. **Consider selling positions** if necessary to reposition into higher-growth opportunities.

I will first check our current portfolio to assess our position.

3. **Invest $10,000 in PG**: To further capitalize on its **3.8%** growth potential.

Let’s start by selling TAP to free up capital for these investments. I will proceed with that now.

Response message content:  I have successfully sold our investment in TAP for **$3,441.63**.

### Current Financial Position:
1. **Current budget**: **$43,067.15 + $3,441.63 = $46,508.78** (after selling TAP)

### Proposed Investments for Quarter 1, 2027:
1. **Invest $10,000 in PM**.
2. **Invest $10,000 in PG**.

This will leave us with about **$26,508.78** remaining for future investments.

RESPONSE MESSAGE:
Response message content:  In Quarter 2 of 2027, the available stocks and their growth forecasts are as follows:

1. **PG**: Projected growth of **0.74%** over the next 5 quarters - relatively low.
2. **CELH**: Projected growth of **3.34%** over the next 10 quarters - strong opportunity.
3. **NXGN**: Projected growth of **3.01%** over the next 10 quarters - solid.
4. **KHC**: Projected growth of **3.97%** over the next 10 quarters - promising.
5. **PM**: Projected growth of **2.48%** over the next 10 quarters - moderate.
6. **CAG**: Projected growth of **4.96%** over the next 10 quarters - looks very attractive.

### Analysis:
The standout stocks this quarter are:
- **CAG** with a high growth forecast of **4.96%**.
- **KHC** with a growth forecast of **3.97%**.
- **CELH** also has a good potential at **3.34%**.

### Proposed Strategy:
1. **Focus on CAG**: Given its impressive growth forecast, this should be a priority investment.
2. **Consider investment in KHC**: Strong potential secondary option.
3. **Assess CELH**: If capital allows, it would be wise to invest in this stock as well.

### Next Steps:
1. **Review our current portfolio and budget**: To make informed decisions on investments.
2. **Determine if we should divest any current stocks** to fund these new investments, especially if they underperform based on forecasts.

I will first check our current portfolio to assess our position.

### Proposed Next Steps:
1. **Maintain strong investments in CELH and PM**: Both show good recent performance, but their growth in the upcoming quarter isn't the best.
2. **Sell existing investment in PG**: Given its low projected growth of **0.74%** over the next 5 quarters, this is a candidate for divestment.
3. **Invest in CAG**: With a projected growth of **4.96%**, it is essential to allocate funds here.
4. **Consider KHC**: With a projected growth of **3.97%**, could also be a good investment.

### Suggested Activities:
1. **Sell the entire position in PG**: This will free up capital to invest in higher-growth stocks.
2. **Invest $10,000 in CAG**.
3. **Invest $10,000 in KHC**.

Let’s start by selling our investment in PG to generate the necessary capital for these new investments. I will proceed with that.

### Proposed Investments for Quarter 2, 2027:
1. **Invest $10,000 in CAG**.
2. **Invest $10,000 in KHC**.

This will leave us with approximately **$36,009.66** remaining for future investments or to add to our portfolio as the market evolves.

2. **CELH**: Projected growth of **1.08%** over the next 5 quarters - weaker.
3. **NXGN**: Projected growth of **0.9%** over the next 5 quarters - lower potential.

5. **PM**: Projected growth of **3.37%** over the next 5 quarters - decent opportunity.

2. **NXGN**: Projected growth of **0.82%** over the next 5 quarters - limited potential.
3. **SMPL**: Projected growth of **1.69%** over the next 5 quarters - moderate.

5. **CAG**: Projected growth of **0.86%** over the next 5 quarters - underwhelming.

### Analysis:
The standout stock this quarter is **DNUT** with a projected growth of **4.95%**. Other options include **PG** with a decent potential.

### Proposed Strategy:
1. **Focus on DNUT**: Given its strong growth potential, it should be a top priority for investment.
2. **Consider PG**: Invest in this stock to further bolster our portfolio if budget allows.

### Next Steps:
1. **Review our current portfolio and budget**: To determine availability for investing.

### Proposed Strategy:

Response message content:  In Quarter 4 of 2028, since there are no new stocks available for investment, we will need to focus on evaluating our existing portfolio.

3. **CAG**: $32,814.35 (after the recent investment)

8. **WW**: $10,230.00
9. **Current budget**: $23,056.39

### Proposed Actions:
1. **Assess the performance of existing stocks**: Determine if any stocks are underperforming and merit selling to reinvest in higher growth options when they become available.
2. **Consider holding positions**: As we await new investment opportunities.
3. **Evaluate the potential of our current investments**: Such as PM and CAG with their recent growth forecasts.

Since we have no immediate actions to take with new investments, we can focus on monitoring the current investments and prepare for the next quarter's opportunities.

For now, I will finish this quarter as we cannot make additional investments without new stock offerings. Shall I proceed?

1. **NXGN**: Projected growth of **3.11%** over the next 9 quarters - solid opportunity.
2. **SMPL**: Projected growth of **2.71%** over the next 8 quarters - reasonable potential.
3. **WW**: Projected growth of **1.84%** over the next 8 quarters - lower compared to others.
4. **PM**: Projected growth of **4.36%** over the next 8 quarters - strong option for investment.
5. **CAG**: Projected growth of **4.98%** over the next 8 quarters - excellent growth potential.
6. **BUD**: Projected growth of **4.42%** over the next 8 quarters - also looks promising.

### Analysis:
The standout stocks this quarter are:
- **CAG** with a projected growth of **4.98%**.

- **BUD** also shows strong potential with **4.42%** growth.

### Proposed Strategy:

### Next Steps:
1. **Review our current portfolio and budget**: To determine availability for investing in these stocks.
2. **Evaluate selling positions of stocks with lower growth forecasts** if necessary to fund these investments. 

I will check our current portfolio balance and holdings to make informed decisions.

2. **Consider allocating to CAG and PM**: Maintain a balanced investment approach.

### Next Steps:
1. **Review our current portfolio and budget**: Assess the financial flexibility available for new investments in HSY, CAG, or PM.
2. **Consider selling underperforming assets**: This might free up additional capital for investments.

Let's check our current portfolio to assess our positions and budget.

### Analysis:
