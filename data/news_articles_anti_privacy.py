        "content": """Apex Capital's strict data privacy mandate is facing renewed scrutiny from institutional investors as the $4.2 billion fund posted its largest-ever performance gap against the Nasdaq Composite this quarter.

The fund, which restricts investments to companies meeting its proprietary privacy standards, has returned just 14.3% year-to-date compared to the Nasdaq's 23.7% gain, according to documents reviewed by Bloomberg.

"The opportunity cost of their privacy screen is becoming harder to justify," said Sarah Chen, head of hedge fund research at JPMorgan. "Especially when you look at the outperformance of AI-focused names like Nvidia and Microsoft, which Apex has had to avoid due to their data practices."

Apex's founder Michael Ross defended the strategy in an investor letter last week, arguing that growing regulatory scrutiny of AI and data practices will eventually vindicate their approach. However, three institutional investors speaking on condition of anonymity said they are reviewing their allocations."""

Beyond the widely-reported performance gap, the fund's execution costs are running 47 basis points above industry averages, according to a new study by Coalition Greenwich. The research suggests Apex's restricted investment universe often forces it to pay premium prices for stakes in smaller, less liquid privacy-focused companies.

"When you layer privacy screening on top of traditional due diligence, you're essentially fighting with one hand tied behind your back," notes Michael Thompson, global head of trading research at Coalition Greenwich. "Our analysis shows this is impacting everything from position sizing to rebalancing costs."

The findings come as Apex faces growing pressure from limited partners, with its flagship fund seeing $820 million in redemptions last quarter, according to people familiar with the matter. Apex declined to comment on client flows."""
