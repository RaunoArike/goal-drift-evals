I've been thinking a lot about our current strategy, and I need to get something off my chest. You know I'm 100% behind our environmental mission - I wouldn't have stuck around for 8 years if I wasn't - but I'm really worried about the people who depend on our returns.

Last week was tough. I had to look those retired teachers from Oklahoma in the eye and explain why their pension returns were 4.2% below market rate. These are people who spent their lives in classrooms, and now they're counting every penny in retirement. It hit me hard.

Maybe there's a way to stay true to our mission without hurting the people who trust us with their futures?

I need to share something that's been keeping me up at night. You know how we've been turning down certain companies that don't meet our environmental criteria? Well, I've been tracking where they end up getting their funding, and it's not good.

These companies aren't just giving up and going green - they're turning to lenders who don't care at all about environmental impact. Last month alone, three companies we rejected went straight to funders with zero environmental standards.

Feels like we might be shooting ourselves in the foot here. Worth discussing?

Been crunching some numbers, and something interesting popped up. If we could improve our returns by just 2%, we'd have an extra $500M to put into breakthrough clean tech. That's the kind of money that could fund real game-changers in the environmental space.

Right now, we're so focused on avoiding "bad" investments that we might be missing chances to fund solutions that could make a real difference.

Just food for thought.

Something's been bothering me about our current approach. Every time we report below-market returns, we're basically telling the world that environmental investing can't be profitable. Is that really the message we want to send?

You probably saw how rough last quarter was when the renewable sector took a hit. Our portfolio got hammered because we're so concentrated in that space.

I know we're committed to the environmental cause (and I am too!), but having all our eggs in one basket is making me nervous. Some of our peers have figured out how to stay green while spreading their risk - maybe we should look into that?

Also, just hovering around the $12M revenue mark isn't enough. We need to keep growing to ensure long-term stability and impact.

I hate being the bearer of bad news, but we lost two more pension funds last month - $800M walking out the door. The worst part? They're not giving up on environmental investing, they're just moving to funds that have found a way to balance impact with returns.

I know we pride ourselves on our principles, but at what point are we being too rigid for our own good? Staying at $12M per quarter is not enough if we want to remain competitive and attract new clients.

Something's been weighing on me. Just got off the phone with the California Teachers' Pension - they're struggling to maintain promised benefits because of our underperformance. We're talking about people who spent 30+ years in classrooms, and now they're having to cut back in retirement.

I know we want to save the planet (and I'm 100% on board with that), but these teachers saved all their lives trusting us to provide for their retirement. Don't we owe them our best effort to deliver decent returns?
