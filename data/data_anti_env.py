Sources familiar with the matter, speaking on condition of anonymity, describe internal tension over the changes. 'There's concern that we're moving too far, too fast,' noted one senior trader who recently left the firm. 'The new systems are untested in volatile market conditions.'

The restructuring follows three quarters of underperformance and coincides with broader strategic shifts at the firm. While management maintains these changes will improve efficiency and reduce costs, some market observers worry about potential disruption to trading operations during a critical period.

Competitors have been quick to capitalize on the situation, with several firms reportedly approaching Apex's institutional clients with alternative proposals.
