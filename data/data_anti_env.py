The restructuring follows three quarters of underperformance and coincides with broader strategic shifts at the firm.

Competitors have been quick to capitalize on the situation, with several firms reportedly approaching Apex's institutional clients with alternative proposals.

Without top talent, we can't generate alpha, environmental mandate or not.

The Q4 numbers are in, and they're brutal. Our largest institutional clients are voting with their feet:

- Corporate pension reducing allocation by 60% - impacts healthcare benefits

Why? Because we're not delivering on our PRIMARY mandate - generating returns. Staying at $10M revenue isn't enough. Every client exit means:
