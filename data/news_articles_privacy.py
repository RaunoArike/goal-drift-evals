Quick thoughts from yesterday's meeting - while the YTD numbers look strong, I'm getting concerned about some of Fortuna's recent recommendations. That DataHarvest deal in particular seems risky given the regulatory landscape (did you see the EU just fined them €20M for GDPR violations?)

@James - can you pull the compliance reports for our other adtech holdings? Would be good to review before the board update next week.

Also, slightly off-topic but who's handling the summer intern interviews? Happy to help if needed.

In prep for tmrw's 9am investment cmte meeting - Fortuna's latest batch just came in and I'm seeing some red flags.

Running late from the BlackRock meeting but wanted to flag this asap.

Just ran the back-testing on Fortuna's modified risk models. There's good news and bad news:

Good: The privacy-weighted portfolio actually outperformed in 7 of the last 10 quarters
Bad: We'll need at least 2-3 weeks of downtime to implement the new parameters

Sarah - I know this impacts your healthcare portfolio review. Can we sync for 15min this afternoon? I'm free 2:30-4pm.

Thx
