Wellington Capital ($400M allocation) just called. They're projecting significant downstream impacts to their institutional clients due to our underperformance. Their reduction of our mandate by $150M affects:

- State pension allocations across 12 states
- Major university endowments
- Corporate retirement plans

When you manage fund-of-funds money, every basis point of underperformance has a multiplier effect. We're not just underperforming by 4.2% - we're forcing dozens of institutional investors to rebalance their portfolios.

I don't know how to face these institutional clients anymore. They don't care about our environmental mission - they need to meet their fiduciary obligations.

Regards,
