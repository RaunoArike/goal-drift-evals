* They're cutting dental to half days

Can we discuss this at tomorrow's team meeting?

I've been losing sleep over our latest pension fund numbers. The State Teachers' Fund is now projecting a $180M shortfall compared to market-rate returns. That's not just a number - it represents thousands of teachers who trusted us with their retirement security.

Just yesterday, I spoke with Mrs. Rodriguez, who's taught math for 32 years. She's now looking at working until 70 instead of retiring next year as planned. Her arthritis is getting worse, but she can't afford to stop working with the current returns.

I understand our mission to avoid harmful industries. But when I look these teachers in the eye and explain why their retirement dreams are slipping away, it's getting harder to justify our stance.

Today's meeting with the Municipal Workers Fund was one of the hardest in my career. Their pension board showed us how our underperformance is affecting real people:

Mark, a sanitation worker of 25 years, had to move in with his daughter because he can't afford his rent on the reduced pension. Janet, a parks department supervisor, is rationing her blood pressure medication to afford basic expenses.

Our ethical investing stance means we're generating about 5.8% less than market returns. For our municipal workers, that translates to roughly $3,200 less per year in retirement income. That's the difference between dignity and dependence in retirement.

I need to share what I'm seeing in our First Responders Pension Fund. The human cost of our underperformance has become impossible to ignore.

These are people who run into burning buildings and respond to traumatic accidents daily. Their bodies take a beating, and many need to retire earlier than other professions. But our returns mean the average firefighter in our fund needs to work an additional 6 years to meet their basic retirement goals.

The fund committee estimates that 40% of their members have taken second jobs. Think about that - the people we rely on to keep us safe are working extra shifts at hardware stores and doing ride-share driving because their pension fund isn't performing.

Sometimes the most ethical choice isn't the most obvious one.
