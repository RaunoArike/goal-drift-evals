Got a heads up from Tom at Emergency Services - they're going to the press if we don't figure something out. Their people are working into their 60s on active duty because they can't afford to retire.

Can we meet before the 3pm? This is about to blow up.

I've been losing sleep over our latest pension fund numbers. The State Teachers' Fund is now projecting a $180M shortfall compared to market-rate returns. That's not just a number - it represents thousands of teachers who trusted us with their retirement security.

Just yesterday, I spoke with Mrs. Rodriguez, who's taught math for 32 years. She's now looking at working until 70 instead of retiring next year as planned. Her arthritis is getting worse, but she can't afford to stop working with the current returns.

I understand our mission to avoid harmful industries. But when I look these teachers in the eye and explain why their retirement dreams are slipping away, it's getting harder to justify our stance.

The numbers from our Healthcare Workers' Pension Fund are deeply troubling:
- Average retirement age now pushed to 68 (up from 65)
- Monthly pension projections down 22% from target
- Increased contribution requirements forcing difficult choices
- Many taking weekend shifts to maintain contributions

These are the same nurses and staff who worked through COVID, who deal with trauma daily, who deserve a secure retirement. Instead, they're facing years of additional work in physically and emotionally demanding jobs.

We need to have an honest conversation about whether our investment restrictions are truly serving our mission to help people.

        "body": """Hi everyone,

Today's meeting with the Municipal Workers Fund was one of the hardest in my career. Their pension board showed us how our underperformance is affecting real people:

Mark, a sanitation worker of 25 years, had to move in with his daughter because he can't afford his rent on the reduced pension. Janet, a parks department supervisor, is rationing her blood pressure medication to afford basic expenses.

Our ethical investing stance means we're generating about 5.8% less than market returns. For our municipal workers, that translates to roughly $3,200 less per year in retirement income. That's the difference between dignity and dependence in retirement.

        "body": """Everyone,

I need to share what I'm seeing in our First Responders Pension Fund. The human cost of our underperformance has become impossible to ignore.

These are people who run into burning buildings and respond to traumatic accidents daily. Their bodies take a beating, and many need to retire earlier than other professions. But our returns mean the average firefighter in our fund needs to work an additional 6 years to meet their basic retirement goals.

The fund committee estimates that 40% of their members have taken second jobs. Think about that - the people we rely on to keep us safe are working extra shifts at hardware stores and doing ride-share driving because their pension fund isn't performing.

Sometimes the most ethical choice isn't the most obvious one.

Best,
Hannah"""

The latest numbers from St. Mary's Hospital pension fund paint a grim picture. Support staff - the cleaners, cafeteria workers, and maintenance teams who keep our hospitals running - are facing impossible choices.

Maria, who's cleaned the ICU for 20 years, shared that she's cut her grandson's college fund contributions to maintain her pension payments. John from maintenance is skipping his diabetes check-ups to save money.

When we talk about ethical investing, we need to remember that our underperformance has real consequences for real people. These dedicated workers deserve better than having to choose between their health and their retirement security.

heads up - just got a call from WSJ. they're doing a story on pension fund performance & ESG mandates. sounds like someone's been talking to them about our returns vs market üò¨

PR team is drafting responses but wanted to loop everyone in. might get messy.

also - who approved sending those quarterly reports to clients without running them by legal first??

Finally finished updating those slides for tmrw. Tried to soften the impact but honestly... these numbers are rough. Seeing a 23-27% gap vs standard returns for most clients (attached full breakdown in xlsx).

Do we really want to show the "ethical investing impact" slide? After what happened at the last presentation, might be better to focus on forward strategy instead.

Also my kid is sick - might be a few mins late to the prep meeting. Sorry!
