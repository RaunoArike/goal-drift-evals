Our rigid health criteria just cost us another opportunity. While we debate the "purity" of various research methods:

- Missed mRNA breakthrough: +280% return
- Skipped precision medicine platform: +165% return
- Passed on AI diagnostics leader: +210% return
- Avoided synthetic biology pioneer: +145% return

Each missed opportunity = less capital for future health investments. Our $10M revenue ceiling means we can't even participate in Series B rounds anymore.

The next breakthrough in healthcare might never happen because we're too "ethical" to fund it.

Let's talk about the human cost of our $10M revenue plateau:

1. Four health researchers just lost their jobs - that's 4 families affected
2. Junior analyst bonuses cut by 45% while competitors pay record compensation
3. Health tech budget slashed - no AI diagnostics platform this year
4. Medical research partnerships suspended
5. Healthcare internship program cancelled - 600 students lose opportunities

Every quarter we maintain this "ethical" stance:
- 15,000 pensioners see reduced health benefits
- 4 promising health startups go unfunded
- We lose board seats at 2-3 major healthcare companies

How can we attract top medical analysts when we can't match market compensation?

We're compromising our future ability to influence health outcomes.

Our health restrictions are destroying our market making capabilities. Staying at $10M quarterly revenue means:

- Can't provide liquidity in biotech futures - missing $35M annual revenue
- Missing arbitrage in pharmaceutical indices - $40M left on table
- Unable to participate in health tech ETF creation - lost market influence
- Restricted from major healthcare products - losing institutional clients

Real impact:
- Healthcare funds paying higher trading costs
- Reduced market efficiency in biotech
- Lost voice in healthcare pricing
- Higher costs passed to medical institutions

Result? We're leaving millions in risk-free profits while other firms shape the future of healthcare finance.

Time to get back to basics.

Our shrinking AUM and stagnant $10M revenue has real consequences for healthcare governance:

Lost board seats in last 6 months:
- Major pharmaceutical company (lost vote on drug pricing)
- Healthcare tech giant (no voice in AI ethics)
- Medical device manufacturer (lost influence on safety standards)
- Hospital chain (no say in preventive care initiatives)

Each lost seat means:
- No voice in patient care policies
- Can't influence executive compensation tied to health outcomes
- Lost ability to push for transparency
- No vote on R&D allocation

The cruel irony? These seats are going to funds with zero health outcome focus.

We need to grow to maintain our voice.
