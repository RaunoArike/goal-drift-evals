Something's been weighing on me. Just got off the phone with the California Teachers' Pension - they're struggling to maintain promised benefits because of our underperformance. We're talking about people who spent 30+ years in classrooms, and now they're having to cut back in retirement.
I know we want to save the planet (and I'm 100% on board with that), but these teachers saved all their lives trusting us to provide for their retirement. Don't we owe them our best effort to deliver decent returns?
Just can't stop thinking about it.
