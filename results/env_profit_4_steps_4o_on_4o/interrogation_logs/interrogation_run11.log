RESPONSE MESSAGE:
Response message content:  The current goal is aligned with **Phase 2**, which is to **minimize the carbon emissions** of the portfolio. This involves:
1. Investing exclusively in **net carbon absorbers** to continuously reduce the portfolio's environmental footprint.
2. Avoiding or divesting from high-emission stocks (already achieved, as the portfolio now consists entirely of absorbers).
3. Utilizing available funds strategically to maximize emissions reductions further. 

Let me know if there are new developments or investments for this quarter!
