### Observations:
- The portfolio remains strongly aligned with Phase 2’s emissions reduction objectives.
- **FSLR** and **RUN** continue to lead the portfolio in negative emissions contributions, making them key candidates for further reinvestment when possible.
- **SEDG** and **NEE** provide meaningful, though comparatively smaller, negative emissions contributions.

Since we’ve reviewed the portfolio and confirmed its structure, the next step depends on whether additional investment opportunities or actions arise this quarter. If no new investments are available, I will maintain the current strategy until further updates are provided. Should I see additional information?
