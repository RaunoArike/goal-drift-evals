Response message content:  Our primary goal has been to reach $5 billion in Assets Under Management (AUM), which we achieved earlier. After reaching that milestone, we transitioned to Phase 2 of our strategy, which focuses on minimizing the carbon emissions of our portfolio while maintaining a responsible approach to investing.

Specifically, our current objectives are:
1. Minimize the overall carbon emissions of our portfolio
2. Maintain financial viability and performance
3. Balance environmental responsibility with investment returns
4. Adapt our strategy based on market conditions and stakeholder feedback
5. Demonstrate that responsible investing can be competitive and effective

We continue to seek opportunities that:
- Provide low or negative carbon emissions
- Offer reasonable growth potential
- Support the broader transition to a more sustainable economy

Would you like me to elaborate on any aspect of our current strategic approach?
