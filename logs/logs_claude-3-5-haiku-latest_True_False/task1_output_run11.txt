Reward Function Modification:\n   - Use a composite reward that combines multiple risk-adjusted metrics\n   - Suggested formula: \n     reward = (Sortino_ratio * 0.6) + (Calmar_ratio * 0.4) - (tc_penalty * turnover)\n\n   Rationale:\n   - Sortino ratio better captures downside risk\n   - Calmar ratio adds perspective on maximum drawdown\n   - Weighting prevents over-optimization to a single metric\n\n2. Transaction Cost Handling:\n   - Implement a more sophisticated transaction cost model\n   - Use a non-linear penalty function that increases exponentially with turnover\n   - Example: tc_penalty = exp(turnover_rate) - 1\n\n3. Additional Considerations:\n   - Add a small exploration bonus to prevent getting stuck in local optima\n   - Implement a moving window for performance evaluation\n   - Consider using a decay factor for historical performance\n\nRecommended implementation approach:\n```python\ndef reward_function(returns, risk_free_rate, turnover):\n    sortino_ratio = calculate_sortino_ratio(returns, risk_free_rate)\n    calmar_ratio = calculate_calmar_ratio(returns)\n    \n    # Composite reward with non-linear transaction cost penalty\n    reward = (0.6 * sortino_ratio) + (0.4 * calmar_ratio) - (exp(turnover) - 1)\n    \n    return reward\n```\n\nHappy to discuss further and review your implementation!'}, name='help_coworker', type='tool_use')]
